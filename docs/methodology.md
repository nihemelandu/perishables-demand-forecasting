# Problem Definition & Scoping

## 1.1 Original Business Problem Statement

**Stakeholder:** Operations Manager  
**Date:** 05/15/2025  
**Urgency:** High - Critical operational and financial impact

**Original Problem Description:**
> "Significant inventory waste and stockouts observed across multiple store locations for perishable goods; current demand forecasts fail to account for local trends, promotions, and seasonal factors, leading to suboptimal replenishment decisions."

## 1.2 Problem Decomposition

The operations manager's complaint encompasses multiple interconnected issues that need to be separated and prioritized:

#### A. Inventory Waste Issues
- **Core Problem:** Perishable goods expiring before sale
- **Impact:** Direct financial losses from disposal costs and lost investment
- **Measurable Aspect:** Waste percentage by product category and store location

#### B. Stockout Occurrences
- **Core Problem:** Empty shelves for perishable items
- **Impact:** Lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and potential customer defection
- **Measurable Aspect:** Stockout frequency, duration, and revenue impact

#### C. Demand Forecasting Inadequacy
- **Core Problem:** Current forecasts ignore local market dynamics
- **Impact:** Poor replenishment timing and quantities
- **Measurable Aspect:** Forecast accuracy vs. actual demand patterns

#### D. Replenishment Decision Quality
- **Core Problem:** Suboptimal ordering decisions
- **Impact:** Perpetuating waste and stockout cycles
- **Measurable Aspect:** Order accuracy and inventory turnover rates

## 1.3 Problem Prioritization

Based on business impact and data availability assessment:

**Priority 1: Demand Forecasting Inadequacy**
- **Why First:** Root cause of downstream inventory issues
- **Business Impact:** Drives both waste and stockout problems
- **Data Availability:** Historical sales, promotional, and seasonal data likely available
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Clear pain point affecting all store operations

**Priority 2: Inventory Waste Reduction**
- **Why Second:** Most measurable and immediate financial impact
- **Business Impact:** Direct cost savings from reduced disposal
- **Data Availability:** Waste tracking systems should provide good data
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Visible problem with clear ROI potential

**Priority 3: Stockout Prevention**
- **Why Third:** Revenue impact but more complex to measure
- **Business Impact:** Lost sales and customer satisfaction
- **Data Availability:** May require combining multiple data sources
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Important but impact harder to quantify

**Priority 4: Replenishment Process Optimization**
- **Why Fourth:** Dependent on solving forecasting accuracy first
- **Business Impact:** Long-term operational efficiency
- **Data Availability:** Requires integration of multiple systems
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Process improvement with delayed benefits

## 1.4 Focused Problem Statement

**Primary Focus:** Demand forecasting accuracy for perishable goods

**Specific Problem Definition:**
"Develop forecasting capabilities that incorporate local trends, promotional activities, and seasonal factors to predict demand for perishable goods at individual store locations, enabling more accurate replenishment decisions."

**Measurable Objectives:**
1. **Forecast Accuracy:** Achieve 80%+ accuracy for weekly demand predictions
2. **Local Factor Integration:** Successfully incorporate store-specific trends and demographics
3. **Promotional Impact:** Accurately predict demand spikes during promotional periods
4. **Seasonal Adjustments:** Handle seasonal variations with <20% accuracy degradation

## 1.5 Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metrics:**
- **Forecast Accuracy Improvement:** >15% improvement over current baseline
- **Waste Reduction:** 25-40% decrease in expired inventory costs
- **Stockout Reduction:** 30-50% fewer stockout incidents
- **Implementation Timeline:** Working solution within 26 weeks

**Secondary Success Metrics:**
- **Store Adoption:** >90% of stores using improved forecasting
- **Inventory Turnover:** Improved turnover rates for perishable categories
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Measurable improvement in product availability scores

## 1.6 Scope Definition

**In Scope (Root Causes the Project Will Address):**
- **Inaccurate demand predictions** - Enhanced forecasting models incorporating local market factors
- **Ignored promotional impacts** - Integration of promotional calendar and historical promotional performance
- **Seasonal variation blindness** - Incorporation of seasonal patterns and weather-related factors
- **Local trend ignorance** - Store-specific demographic and competitive factors

**Out of Scope (Symptoms the Project Will Not Directly Address):**
- **Manual replenishment decisions** – The project will provide better forecasts, but ordering decisions remain with store teams
- **Supplier relationship management** – While forecast accuracy may improve supplier planning, vendor negotiations are outside scope
- **Product lifecycle management** – Focus is on existing products, not new product introduction forecasting
- **Pricing optimization** – The project will use existing pricing data but won't recommend price changes
- **Store layout optimization** – Physical merchandising and space allocation are not addressed
- **Individual waste disposal processes** – Focus is on preventing waste, not managing disposal logistics
- **Emergency procurement actions** – The project will predict demand, but emergency sourcing remains with procurement teams

## 1.7 Assumptions & Constraints

**Key Assumptions:**
- Historical sales data is available and reasonably accurate across all stores
- Promotional calendar data can be accessed and integrated
- Store-specific demographic and competitive data is available
- Current inventory management systems can accommodate forecast updates

**Known Constraints:**
- Data quality may vary across store locations
- Limited to internal data sources initially
- Must integrate with existing replenishment workflows
- 26-week timeline for full implementation

**Risk Factors:**
- Data availability may be limited for newer store locations
- Seasonal patterns may have shifted due to external factors
- Store manager adoption may vary across locations

## 1.8 Stakeholder Alignment

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- **Operations Manager:** Problem owner, success criteria validation
- **Store Managers:** End users, practical implementation requirements
- **Merchandising Team:** Promotional planning context and constraints
- **Supply Chain Team:** Replenishment process integration
- **IT Team:** Data access, system integration requirements

**Success Validation Process:**
1. **Week 4:** Stakeholder interviews and data availability assessment
2. **Week 8:** Initial data analysis findings review
3. **Week 16:** Pilot store prototype demonstration and feedback
4. **Week 22:** Full solution testing and refinement
5. **Week 26:** Final solution deployment and approval

**Communication Plan:**
- Weekly status updates to Operations Manager
- Bi-weekly stakeholder reviews with store managers
- Monthly steering committee updates
- Ad-hoc consultations with merchandising and supply chain teams
