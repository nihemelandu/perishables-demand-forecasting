# Problem Definition & Scoping

## 1.1 Original Business Problem Statement

**Stakeholder:** Operations Manager  
**Date:** 05/15/2025  
**Urgency:** High - Critical operational and financial impact

**Original Problem Description:**
> "Significant inventory waste and stockouts observed across multiple store locations for perishable goods; current demand forecasts fail to account for local trends, promotions, and seasonal factors, leading to suboptimal replenishment decisions."

## 1.2 Problem Decomposition

The operations manager's complaint encompasses multiple interconnected issues that need to be separated and prioritized:

#### A. Inventory Waste Issues
- **Core Problem:** Perishable goods expiring before sale
- **Impact:** Direct financial losses from disposal costs and lost investment
- **Measurable Aspect:** Waste percentage by product category and store location

#### B. Stockout Occurrences
- **Core Problem:** Empty shelves for perishable items
- **Impact:** Lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, and potential customer defection
- **Measurable Aspect:** Stockout frequency, duration, and revenue impact

#### C. Demand Forecasting Inadequacy
- **Core Problem:** Current forecasts ignore local market dynamics
- **Impact:** Poor replenishment timing and quantities
- **Measurable Aspect:** Forecast accuracy vs. actual demand patterns

#### D. Replenishment Decision Quality
- **Core Problem:** Suboptimal ordering decisions
- **Impact:** Perpetuating waste and stockout cycles
- **Measurable Aspect:** Order accuracy and inventory turnover rates

## 1.3 Problem Prioritization

Based on business impact and data availability assessment:

**Priority 1: Demand Forecasting Inadequacy**
- **Why First:** Root cause of downstream inventory issues
- **Business Impact:** Drives both waste and stockout problems
- **Data Availability:** Historical sales, promotional, and seasonal data likely available
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Clear pain point affecting all store operations

**Priority 2: Inventory Waste Reduction**
- **Why Second:** Most measurable and immediate financial impact
- **Business Impact:** Direct cost savings from reduced disposal
- **Data Availability:** Waste tracking systems should provide good data
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Visible problem with clear ROI potential

**Priority 3: Stockout Prevention**
- **Why Third:** Revenue impact but more complex to measure
- **Business Impact:** Lost sales and customer satisfaction
- **Data Availability:** May require combining multiple data sources
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Important but impact harder to quantify

**Priority 4: Replenishment Process Optimization**
- **Why Fourth:** Dependent on solving forecasting accuracy first
- **Business Impact:** Long-term operational efficiency
- **Data Availability:** Requires integration of multiple systems
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Process improvement with delayed benefits

## 1.6 Scope Definition

### âœ… In Scope

These areas will be addressed in the current project. They align with the root causes of the business problem and are feasible given data availability and timeline.

| Scope Item | Description | Clarifying Questions |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Inaccurate demand predictions** | Improve forecasting for perishable goods at the store-product level. | - What exactly are we forecasting (daily, weekly, promo windows)?<br>- What is the current forecast accuracy baseline?<br>- What level of granularity is needed (store-product)? |
| **Local market influences** | Incorporate demographic, competitive, and neighborhood-specific data into forecasts. | - What local data is available?<br>- At what frequency and level of resolution?<br>- How is local behavior known to impact demand? |
| **Promotional impact modeling** | Use past promotions and outcomes to adjust future forecasts. | - Is promotion data structured and linked to sales outcomes?<br>- Can we isolate promo effects from other trends? |
| **Seasonality and external patterns** | Account for seasonal trends, events, and external demand drivers. | - How many seasonal cycles are modeled?<br>- Have recent years deviated from historical patterns? |
| **Forecast-driven replenishment guidance** | Deliver improved demand forecasts to support replenishment teams. | - Who will consume these forecasts (store managers, planners)?<br>- How are forecasts currently integrated into decisions? |

### ðŸš« Out of Scope

The following areas are not included in this project. They fall outside the root cause domain or require separate solutions.

| Not in Scope | Reason | Clarifying Questions |
|--------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Manual ordering behavior** | Decisions remain with store teams; this project provides better inputs only. | - Who owns ordering decisions?<br>- Will behavior change be needed for adoption? |
| **Supplier/vendor management** | This initiative does not address upstream supply chain constraints. | - Are suppliers part of this planning process?<br>- Will forecasts affect procurement timelines? |
| **Product lifecycle forecasting** | Focus is on existing SKUs with historical data. | - How are new products handled?<br>- Is lifecycle forecasting owned by another team? |
| **Pricing optimization** | Forecasts will use current pricing as-is. No pricing changes will be recommended. | - Are pricing changes documented?<br>- Could pricing shifts affect model outcomes? |
| **Store layout and merchandising** | Physical display decisions are excluded. | - Are merchandising effects modeled or documented?<br>- Does store layout vary significantly? |
| **Waste disposal processes** | This project aims to reduce waste, not manage disposal logistics. | - Is waste cost data available for measurement?<br>- Who manages disposal at store level? |
| **Emergency procurement actions** | The model does not account for ad hoc procurement. | - Are emergencies common?<br>- Will this project affect their frequency? |

## 1.9 Problem Translation to Data Science Task

**Data Science Task:**  
**Localized Time Series Forecasting for Perishable Demand**

**Translation Summary:**  
The core issue of inaccurate perishable demand forecasts is reframed as a data science problem focused on **forecasting future sales volume of perishable items at the store-product level**, while accounting for **exogenous variables** that impact demand. This enables improved replenishment decisions, reducing both spoilage and stockouts.

### **Task Formulation:**
- **Type:** Supervised Time Series Forecasting  
- **Target Variable:** Weekly (or daily) sales quantity per SKU per store  
- **Features (Covariates):**
  - Historical sales data
  - Local demographic indicators
  - Promotional activity calendars
  - Seasonal and holiday events
  - Weather and regional patterns (if available)

### **Modeling Approach:**
- **Baseline Models:** ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
- **Enhanced Models:** Time Series with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX), Holt-Winters with seasonality
- **Alternative Options:** Gradient boosting or RNNs if traditional models underperform due to nonlinearity


### **Performance Metrics:**
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Forecast bias (over/under-prediction tendencies)
- Business KPIs: Waste %, stockout duration, inventory turnover

### **Outcome Goals:**
- Improve forecast accuracy by >15%
- Reduce spoilage by 25%
- Decrease average stockout duration by 5 days
- Provide actionable insights via store-level dashboards for replenishment planners
